This repository contains a variety of tools that have been developed to assist in the development implementation and 
administration of ThoughtSpot.  

Note that all tools are provided AS-IS according to the MIT license (see below).  While these have been 
QAd, tested, and used in ThoughtSpot environments, every environment is different.  
Use these only if you know what you are doing.
**You should always take a snapshot before you make significant changes to your environment.**

If you have questions about the tools, please direct you questions to the ThoughtSpot community:

We hope you find these tools useful.  Please provide feedback in the Community along with suggestions 
for improvements or additional tools.
