# community-tools
This repository contains a variety of tools that have been developed to assist in the development implementation and administration of ThoughtSpot.  

Note that all tools are provided AS-IS according to the MIT license.  While these have been QAd, tested, and used in ThoughtSpot environments, every environment is different.

If you have questions about the tools, please direct you questions to the ThoughtSpot community:  http://community.thoughtspot.com.  

We hope you find these tools useful.  Please provide feedback in the Community along with suggestions.

And if you'd like to contribute, you can fork the repository and then do pull requests.  Your code will be subjected to the same code expectations that we apply to own code.
